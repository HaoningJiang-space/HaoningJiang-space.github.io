This paper presents GRAIN, a design-intent-driven interactive analog layout migration framework that preserves layout intent via DBSCAN-based clustering and intra/inter-cluster compaction. The framework achieves 45.4% performance improvement in 65nm→40nm/28nm migrations while maintaining routing features through abstract-path-guided maze routing.
